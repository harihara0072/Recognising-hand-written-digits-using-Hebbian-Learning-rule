# Recognising-hand-written-digits-using-Hebbian-Learning-rule

This program is an implemention of a single layer neural network with 10 nodes. Which contains

Slider 1-alpha (learning rate) : Ranging between 0.001 and 1.0. Default value = 0.1

Buttons 1-"Adjust Weights (Learn)":  When this button is pressed the selected Hebbian learning rule should  be applied for 100 epochs.

Button 2-"Rondomize Weights": When this button is pressed weights and biases should be randomized. The value of the randomized weights and biases should be from -0.001 to 0.001.

Button3-"Display Confusion Matrix": When this button is pressed the confusion matrix for the test set should be displayed.
 
Drop-Down1-"Select Learning Method": A drop-down box to select one of the three Hebbian rules from your textbook, i.e. "Filtered Learning (Smoothing)", "Delta Rule", or "Unsupervised Hebb".

Drop-Down2-"Transfer Functions": A drop-down box to allow the user to select between three transfer functions (Symmetrical Hard limit, Hyperbolic Tangent, and Linear)
